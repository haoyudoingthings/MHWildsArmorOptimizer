# MHWildsArmorOptimizer

MHWilds armor optimizer with effective attack power as the target function

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and wait for results

This optimizer is currently made with optimization for greatswords in mind, therefore you will see stuff like Burst only providing 5 atk. You can change the effects in `data.py`

## TODO

1. Refactor configs into another file
2. Allow more complicated skill effects (e.g. Gore Magala's Tyranny)
3. Improve efficiency of armor search
